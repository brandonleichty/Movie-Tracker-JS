  // entire app in the "App" component.

  // Site wide state includes:
  // 1. "user" - if a user is logged in, this will hold the user object returned from Firebase. By defaul it's set to null.

  // 2. "welcomePage" (maybe rename this variable? üßê) - if it's the user's first time visiting the page, and they're not currently
  //    logged in, users will be shown a welcome screen that invites them to add the first movie to their collection.
  //    welcomePage is set to "true" by default;

  // 3. "movieGrid" is the array that will store all the movies being displayed on the screen. It's an empty array by default.
  //    Once data is fetched from TMDB it'll be filled with movies.

  // 4. "userMovies" is the array that will hold each movie that a user has seen (onces they've clicked on). If no user is logged in,
  //    the users movies will only be stored in the local "App" state. Once a user is logged in, the state will sync in "real time" with Firebase/Firestore.

  // 5. I will be using emojis in my code comments. üôå I'm sorry if that offends anyone. üòú
