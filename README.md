# Movie Tracker JS

Movie Tracker was designed as my final project for Threehouse's Full Stack JavaScript [Techdegree](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ "Treehouse Techdegree"). 

This project uses a handful of technologoes, including but not limited to:

- React
- Firebase
- Twilio
- MongoDB
- Express

Part of the project requirements were to use a minimum of *two APIs*. I decided to use APIs from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) (for sms messaging), and The [Movie Database (TMBd)] (https://www.themoviedb.org).

## About Movie Tracker:

I'm a huge fan of movies and the overall movie theater experience. And I wanted to create something I was passionate about and had an interest in. I see a lot a movies in theaters, and realized that at the end of each year I have a hard time remembering which movies I've seen. 

## The purpose of this site is to: 

A) Allow you to keep track of the movies you've seen.
B) Send you SMS updates the day before movies you want to see are released in theaters.
