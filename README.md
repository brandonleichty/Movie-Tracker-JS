# Movie Tracker JS

Movie Tracker was designed as my final project for Threehouse's Full Stack JavaScript [Techdegree](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ "Treehouse Techdegree"). 

This project uses a handful of technologoes, including but not limited to: 

- React
- Firebase
- Twilio
- MongoDB
- Express

Part of the project requirements were to use a minimum of *two APIs*. I decided to use APIs from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) (for sms messaging), and The [Movie Database (TMBd)] (https://www.themoviedb.org).
